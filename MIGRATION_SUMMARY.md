# Business Entity Migration Summary

The system has been successfully refactored to use a unified business entity model instead of separate customer and supplier schemas.

## Key Changes:
1. Deleted old schema files (customers.ts and suppliers.ts)
2. Created new unified API routes under /business-entities
3. Updated schema exports to exclude old schemas
4. Business entity schema already exists with all required fields

## New API Endpoints:
- GET/POST /api/workspaces/[workspaceId]/companies/[companyId]/business-entities
- GET/PATCH/DELETE /api/workspaces/[workspaceId]/companies/[companyId]/business-entities/[entityId]
- Subroutes for addresses, contacts, files, and notes

## Benefits:
- Single source of truth for entities that are both customers and suppliers
- Reduced data duplication
- Simplified maintenance
- More flexible business relationships
